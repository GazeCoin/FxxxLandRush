# FXXX LandRush

Smart contract to allow purchases of FXXX parcels of land using [GZE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4ac00f287f36a6aad655281fe1ca6798c9cb727b) (GazeCoin Metaverse Token) or ethers (ETH).

The price of each parcel of land is USD 1,500 (and some parcels with variations of this amount). The ETH amount is calculated using the [MakerDAO ETH/USD pricefeed](https://makerdao.com/feeds/) at [0x729D19f657BD0614b4985Cf1D82531c67569197B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x729D19f657BD0614b4985Cf1D82531c67569197B#readContract).

The GZE amount is calculated using a less frequently updated GZE/ETH [pricefeed](contracts/PriceFeed.sol) that is deployed as part of these smart contracts.
